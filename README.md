This week's Makers project is a clone of Instagram (of course all test driven). The goal is to continue to enhance knowledge of Rails, and other advanced concepts such as:

- Uploading and processing images using Paperclip, hosting via Amazon S3
- Managing secret information (e.g. private keys)
- Many-to-many relationships in Rails (with tagging)
- Geocoding with Google Maps
- Twitter Bootstrap
- Creating APIs using Rails + jBuilder

Specifications:
---------------
- [ ] Users can register/sign up (implemented with Devise)
- [ ] Users must be signed in to create new posts
- [ ] Posts can be created by providing a title and attaching an image
- [ ] The image should be processed using Paperclip, to generate thumbnail-sized images
